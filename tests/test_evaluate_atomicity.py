"""Tests for v1.5.0+ atomic A/B benchmark write (the bootloader pattern).

The user explicitly asked: 'A modifies B, switch to B only after test
passes'.  These tests verify:
  1. node_evaluate writes core/planner.py atomically (via .tmp)
  2. If the process is killed mid-benchmark, core/planner.py is
     either original OR patched, never half-written
  3. After node_evaluate finishes (success or failure), the
     .bench_bak and .bench_tmp files are cleaned up
  4. core.* modules are evicted from sys.modules so the patched
     file is actually loaded by run_all()
