This file is the L2 detail; the summary in
`docs/TODO_SESSION_PERSISTENCE.md` is the L0/L1.

## Open questions (per M-self-application 4 levels)

These are **deferred** — answer when first snapshot
implementing this proposal is written.

1. **Format enforcement**: should snapshots have a strict
   YAML frontmatter (machine-readable) or stay free-form
   markdown (human-readable)?
2. **Tier 1 vs Tier 2**: default to Tier 2 (in repo) for
   all snapshots, or only when user signals "save
   persistently"?
3. **Snapshot count limit**: should there be a per-topic
   cap (e.g. keep last 5 snapshots of "sua-onboarding")?
4. **Cross-project sharing**: if user works on multiple
   projects, do snapshots conflict by topic name?

## Implementation steps (when ready)

Per "1 commit = 1 logical feature":

1. **Commit 1**: write this proposal doc + add reference
   from `docs/OPERATING_RULES.md` M-context-snapshot 段
   + `AGENTS.md` See-also
2. **Commit 2 (later)**: implement Tier 1 snapshot format
   (write_file helper script)
3. **Commit 3 (later)**: implement Tier 2 archive step
   (move to `agent-tools/snapshots/`)
4. **Commit 4 (later)**: implement restore protocol helper
5. **Commit 5 (later)**: write first real snapshot using
   the new format + verify restore works

Per "P23 doc > script with nuance": 1-2 doc-only commits
first, then scripts when design is stable.
