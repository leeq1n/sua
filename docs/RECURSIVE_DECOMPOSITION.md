# Recursive decomposition (per user meta-rule, 2026-07-13)

> L0: 5-step loop for big tasks (THINK → DECOMPOSE → ORDER →
> EXECUTE → INTEGRATE).  Load when task is "big" (multi-file,
> multi-project, multi-step).  Don't load for 1-2 step tasks.

## When to use this

Load this doc when:
- Task is multi-file or multi-project scope.
- Task spans more than ~5 tool calls.
- You find yourself unsure of scope.
- User said "大任务" or similar.

Don't load this doc for:
- 1-2 step tasks (e.g. "fix this typo").
- Single-file changes.
- Trivial edits.

## The 5-step loop

For **big tasks** (multi-file changes, multi-project scope,
sustained effort over many turns), do **not** start coding
immediately.  Instead, follow this loop:

```
big task T
  ├─ 1. THINK: what is T actually?  Is it really one task or N?
  ├─ 2. DECOMPOSE: split T into T1, T2, ..., TN (sub-tasks).
  │        Each Ti should be a leaf (1 logical change, 1 commit).
  │        Stop decomposing when each leaf is small enough that
  │        the "1 commit = 1 logical feature" rule (P4) holds.
  ├─ 3. ORDER: detect dependencies between Ti.  If T2 needs T1
  │        done first, mark T2 as 'after T1'.
  ├─ 4. EXECUTE: do T1 (commit + verify), then T2 (commit + verify), ...
  └─ 5. INTEGRATE-AND-THINK: after all Ti done, re-think.  Is the
           whole T actually complete?  Did the sub-tasks reveal
           a new sub-task?  Should any Ti be revisited?
           This is also the **M-learn trigger point** (see
           OPERATING_RULES.md M-learn) — at every parent-task
           integration, ask: did this surface something that
           generalizes beyond itself?
```

This loop is **recursive**: each Ti may itself be a "big task"
relative to its sub-tasks.  Decompose until each leaf is small.

## Context flow across recursion layers

When this loop is **nested** (Ti is itself a parent task with
sub-tasks Si1, Si2, ..., SiN), the integration output of Ti
(layer N) becomes the **context input** for the parent's
integration step (layer N+1).  In other words:

```
Layer N+1's INTEGRATE step consumes the summaries of N's leaves.
```

Concretely:
- Each leaf writes a **M-subtask-summary** (in commit message).
- The parent task's INTEGRATE step reads those summaries to
  assess "is the whole T complete?" — without re-reading
  every diff.  This is what M-subtask-summary is for.
- If the parent is itself a sub-task of a larger task, the
  parent's INTEGRATE output (its own final summary) flows
  upward as **layer N's contribution to layer N+1's
  INTEGRATE**.  The recursion is the data flow.

This is why summaries at each layer must be **identifiable**
(by layer + sub-task ID in commit message or in Temp
snapshot filename).  Without the layer marker, the parent
cannot tell whether two summaries are siblings (same layer)
or parent-child (different layers).  See `sua-snapshot-
<topic>-<date>.md` filename convention for the pattern
(per OPERATING_RULES.md M-context-snapshot).

Failure mode this prevents: agent re-reads all leaves because
summaries look identical → silent context bloat → slow or
incomplete integration.  Layer markers make integration
**O(summaries)**, not **O(code)**.

## Real L2 examples (this project)

- "Make SUA doc maintenance self-updating" → decompose into:
  (a) AGENTS.md onboarding contract, (b) commit-msg hook for
  P-n enforcement, (c) bulk Last P20-verified refresh, (d) P2
  search spec with 'search-then-update' contract, (e) future
  pre-commit-doc-check hook.
- "Audit outdated docs" → decompose into:
  (a) grep for Last P20-verified <30 days, (b) per-file review
  for content drift, (c) prioritize fixes by user-facing impact,
  (d) fix in 1-commit-per-doc order.
- "Adjust SUA docs per new-agent-perspective principle" →
  decompose into: (a) bulk L0 add for docs missing it,
  (b) extract Recursive decomposition to this doc, (c) extract
  Operating rules to dedicated doc, (d) rewrite AGENTS.md to
  always-on only, (e) add conditional read-order pointers.

## Anti-patterns (what NOT to do)

- **Don't skip step 1** (THINK).  Jumping straight to coding
  on a big task = "yellow claimed as green" (P17).
- **Don't skip step 5** (INTEGRATE).  After 3 leaf commits, the
  whole task may still be incomplete; re-evaluate.
- **Don't decompose too finely** (1 commit per file is fine;
  1 commit per line is silly).  Stop when leaf size ≈ 1-3 files
  or 1-50 LOC.
- **Don't forget the layer marker** in summaries.  Without
  it, parent INTEGRATE cannot distinguish sibling summaries
  from parent-child summaries.  (See "Context flow across
  recursion layers" above.)

## Per P22 (stuck → plan)

When you find yourself unsure mid-task, fall back to step 1
(THINK) and re-decompose.

## Per P14 (docs stay current)

If decomposition reveals a doc drift, fix the doc in the same
task (not a separate one).
