## When to use this

Load this doc when:
- Ending a task (M-task-summary).
- Switching tasks (M-context-snapshot) — even briefly,
  even if the switched-away task is small.
- Unsure which docs to read first (M-must-read).
- Mid multi-leaf task and need to summarize (M-subtask-summary).
- User input is messy / scattered / mixes multiple asks
  (M-intent-parsing).
- At a decomposition integration point (all sub-tasks of a
  parent task complete; M-learn).
- Context / docs / commit history feels cluttered, or
  multiple docs drifted (M-add-then-reduce signal).
- Before declaring "all pass" (M-self-audit) — fresh-
  agent discoverability check.
- Encountering any new rule or pattern (M-self-application)
  — apply at 4 levels (task, rule itself, memory, self).

## What these rules are

These are **operating workflow rules** (M-* prefix), not P-n
— they govern how the agent *works*, not what the work *is*.
Full context lives in PRINCIPLES.md (P-n list) and
PRINCIPLES_DETAIL.md (P-n full text).

Per P23 (doc > script with nuance): "Don't write a script
until doc rule has been broken 3+ times" — same applies to
adding new P-n.  These 7 rules are workflow guidance, not
principles, so they live in OPERATING_RULES.md, not
PRINCIPLES.md.

## The 9 rules

### M-task-summary

After every task completion, briefly state what went well
(and what could improve).  Decide whether the project's docs
should be updated based on what you learned; if yes, include
the doc fix in the same task (per P14 docs-stay-current).

**Child-summary destroy contract**:
when M-task-summary completes for a parent task that has
N child tasks, the summary commit MUST pull N child
summaries, write the parent summary, then destroy the
N child summaries (auditable via commit message body,
per P17).  Silent destroy = drift.

Full contract (3 steps, why explicit destroy, 奥卡姆
alignment, code-task variant, relationship to M-subtask-
summary + M-add-then-reduce) lives in
`docs/SUMMARY_LIFECYCLE.md` — load when implementing a
parent-level M-task-summary.

### M-must-read

For principles that are needed *every* session (e.g. P5 测通,
P11 摘要+引用, P17 老实说, P22 stuck→plan), surface them in
`AGENTS.md` "Hard rules" above (already done).  **Do NOT**
add to AGENTS.md the full text of every P-n — that bloats
context.  AGENTS.md is a pointer to PRINCIPLES.md, not a
copy (per P11).

### M-context-snapshot

Before switching tasks, capture the current session's state
to a `session_search`-able artifact (or to a brief note).
On return, load the snapshot to restore context.  **Don't**
try to keep all context in the live conversation — overflow
silently breaks the agent.  Implementation details
(snapshot format, restore mechanism) are in
`docs/TODO_SESSION_PERSISTENCE.md` (proposal — t8).

**Switch signals**: a "switch" is any
of these, regardless of perceived size or duration:
- User says "switch to X" / "let's do something else" /
  mentions a different topic
- User's message arrives after a long pause (context may
  have rotated out)
- Agent notices context overflow risk (file reads in this
  session > 50, multiple M-task-summary points, or
  conversation > N turns without a summary)
- A new task type appears (debugging → design → write → ...)
- Agent itself is about to switch focus (delegate_task,
  process management, long sleep)

Full heuristic (5 signals in detail, anti-patterns,
what goes in a snapshot, location convention) lives in
`docs/SWITCH_SIGNALS.md` — load when evaluating whether
current context is a switch.  **Action when a signal
fires** (decision tree: same-topic refinement vs new
topic vs tiny insertion) lives in SWITCH_SIGNALS.md
"Switch action protocol" 段 — load that段 BEFORE
responding to the message.

**Don't** judge by perceived task size: a "small switch"
can still lose critical in-flight state (open todos,
uncommitted snapshots, mid-iteration assumptions).
Snapshot cost is low; recovery from missing snapshot is
high.

**Snapshot trigger is automatic, not user-requested**.
User should not have to remind agent to snapshot.

**Snapshot location convention**:
`sua-snapshot-<topic>-<date>.md` (use
`tempfile.mkstemp(prefix="sua-snapshot-",
dir=os.environ.get("TEMP", "/tmp"))` per OS-safe
tempfile path convention)
(session_search-able by title).  NOT in repo unless user
asks (Temp gets cleared on session restart, so don't rely
on long-term).

### M-subtask-summary

For multi-leaf tasks, each leaf commit should include a
1-2 line summary in its commit message body.  When the agent
returns for the integration step (5-step loop step 5), it
should NOT need to re-read every leaf's diff — the summaries
suffice.

### M-intent-parsing

When user input is messy (multiple asks, scattered,
contradicts itself), **first find the user's actual goal**
(the "main contradiction", per 主要矛盾), then plan
backward from the goal.  3 actions in order: extract goal →
identify main contradiction → plan backward.

Default to EXECUTE, not ask-again (per user directive
'trust you / next / go').

Full text (3 actions detail, anti-pattern, trust-trigger
quote) lives in `docs/OPERATING_RULES_DETAIL.md` —
load when implementing M-intent-parsing on messy input.

### M-learn

After a decomposition **integration point** (all sub-tasks
of a parent task complete — RECURSIVE_DECOMPOSITION 5-step
loop step 5), ask: did this task surface something that
generalizes beyond itself?  If yes, capture it.

Trigger is dual-track: structural (always at INTEGRATE) +
signal (context overflow / 乱 / doc drift > 2 files).  3
sub-actions in order: 总结归纳 → 类比外推 → 更新知识库.

**Per 奥卡姆 (P7)** — silent no-op (don't write "checked,
nothing new"; every "checked" line is itself a P-n violation).

Full text (dual-track triggers in detail, 3 sub-actions
in detail, relationship to other M-* rules, anti-pattern)
lives in `docs/OPERATING_RULES_DETAIL.md` — load when
applying M-learn at an integration point.

### M-add-then-reduce

Tasks have a 2-phase lifecycle; the cycle repeats: Add
(gather / write / push) + Reduce (consolidate / dedupe /
destroy).  Full rule (trigger table, why signal-triggered,
add-then-reduce sequence, reduce phase actions, anti-patterns,
relationship to other M-* rules) lives in
`docs/ADD_THEN_REDUCE.md` — load when planning a multi-
leaf task or applying M-learn.

For open-ended discovery, design, planning, or hypothesis formation, Add also
means bounded constructive search-space expansion, not merely accumulating
artifacts or evidence. Synthesize that expansion before terminal critique.
Well-specified execution uses the direct path and incurs no creativity gate.

If locally valid terminal decisions repeat while producing no surviving
alternative or output-space expansion, STOP the local loop and schedule a
controller-level replan. There is no fixed rejection count; use repeated
same-structure termination plus lack of global progress as the trigger.

### M-self-audit

Frequently ask yourself: "If a new agent entered this
project right now, could it read what it needs to do the
task?"  Triggers: before declaring "all pass" (per M-task-
summary invariant), after adding new doc/section (is it
discoverable from L0?), or after adding 4th section to
AGENTS.md (am I bloating past 300-line cap?).

Full rule (when-to-apply, 6-step audit checklist
including step 6 "verify-before-edit" — see
`docs/M_SELF_AUDIT.md` for detail) lives in
`docs/M_SELF_AUDIT.md` — load before "all pass",
before any Edit/Write on a previously-read file
(per step 6), or after big doc changes.

### M-self-application

When you encounter a rule or pattern, apply it at 4 levels:
(1) to current task, (2) to the rule itself (meta), (3) to
memory / project structure (organizational), (4) to your
own operating behavior (self).  If you find a class of
cases where the rule applies but you didn't apply it,
that's a "self-application gap" — surface and fix.

Bootstrap exception: M-self-application does NOT apply to
itself (infinite recursion).  Per honest reporting (P17):
60-70% reduction realistic, not 100% (LLM training data may
lack self-referential examples).
