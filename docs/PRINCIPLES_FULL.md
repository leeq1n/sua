## Meta principles

## Data Flow (P19)

**P19: Data flow observability**

When functions execute sequentially (A → B → C), persist A's
output to disk so B can read it without re-running A.  This:
  - Makes the data flow observable (`cat upgrades/foo.jsonl`)
  - Lets us replay a step without redoing prior steps
  - Lets us debug which input led to which output
  - Survives crashes (we can pick up where we left off)

Per user insight 2026-07-09: '如果有几个功能是顺序执行,
你可以先把前面的输出存下来, 作为下一个功能的输入'.

Concrete pattern in v3.0.1:
  - `read_papers()` -> `save_summaries()` (JSONL overwrite)
  - `read_summaries()` -> `select_best()` -> `save_decision()` (JSONL append)

Format: JSONL (one record per line).  Append-only for events,
single-snapshot for state.

**实操 (L2)**: per sequential function chain, write `save_X()` +
`read_X()` to `upgrades/X.jsonl`.  Per Test + Doc roots.

**Cross-ref to OPERATING_RULES.md M-task-summary
destroy contract**: P19 says "persist intermediate
state"; the destroy contract says "destroy
intermediate state after parent consumes it".
These are **complementary, not contradictory** —
P19 = add-phase (persist for replay/debug);
destroy contract = reduce-phase (clean up
consumed intermediates).  For batch / multi-leaf
tasks, see `docs/SUMMARY_LIFECYCLE.md` and the
"Child-summary destroy contract" sub-section in
`docs/OPERATING_RULES.md` M-task-summary段.

**Note (per commit 45, 2026-07-14)**: P19 moved here from above References section (was at line 113) for numerical order (P19 → P20 → P20.细则 → P21 → P22/P23 in PRINCIPLES_DETAIL.md → P24 → P25 → P26). Per user meta-rule "原则顺序不是一成不变的" (commit 42) + "自顶向下" (commit 44), P-n sections should be in numerical order within their containing段.
### P20. 渐进式披露 (progressive disclosure)

Documents should expose content in layers, each layer addressing a
different consumer question.  The default reader is an agent that
DOES NOT know the project's full context — it should be able to
read **only the layers it needs** and stop.

**实操 (L2)**: every new doc starts with L0 (1-line header) +
L1 (1-3 paragraphs).  L2 is the rest.  Per Doc root.

Three layers, in order of increasing cost:

| Layer | Question it answers | When to write | When the agent reads it |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 — Pointer | "Where do I look?" | Always (header line) | Default (always read) |
| L1 — Summary | "What is this in 30 seconds?" | Always (1-3 paragraphs) | When L0 matches a need |
| L2 — Detail | "Give me the full story" | Optional, by file size | When L1 prompts a question |

Rules:
- A document with no L1 is **stealth** — only the agent that
  actively searches for it finds it.  Use for cross-project
  pointers (e.g. `docs/EXTENSIONS.md`) and ideas-not-yet-projects.
- A document's L1 must be readable in < 2 min (target ≤ 2KB).
  A document's L2 is for the consumer who already knows they
  need the full story (target ≤ 7KB).  If longer, the document
  is doing two jobs and should be split (P11 applies).
- L0 must be a single line (or short table cell).  No prose.
- P20 is recursive: this principle's own definition follows P20.
  L0 = the section header, L1 = this paragraph, L2 = the table.

Failure mode P20 guards against:
- An agent that "doesn't know there's an EXTENSIONS.md" loads
  every file referenced in INDEX.md.  That defeats the purpose
  of having a per-doc L0.
- An agent that "knows" a doc exists, reads all of it, including
  the parts not relevant to its task.  P20 layers let the agent
  stop after L0 or L1.

### P20.细则 (concrete rules — mechanical, not interpreted)

> P20 is the principle (abstract); this list is the binding
> contract.  Each rule is doc-level (mentally checked by future
> agents per P20 self-discipline).  Per the user's 2026-07-10
> framing: "原则 (P20) = 抽象类, 细则 = 具体实现".

| # | Rule | Failure mode it catches |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | `INDEX.md` must contain exactly two top-level sections after the intro: "Reading order for a new agent" and "Conditional loads".  No third category. | A new doc created and added to INDEX as "Helpful resources" or "Other" — bypasses the layer contract. |
| R2 | The "Reading order" section must number its links 1..N contiguously (no gaps, no duplicates). | Renumbering accident or skipped step that confuses the reader. |
| R3 | Every link in "Conditional loads" must have a `trigger:` annotation (one line, ≥ 5 words) describing when to read it. | Stealth doc with no clear "when to read" — defeats the purpose of being conditional. |
| R4 | `EXTENSIONS.md` must be ≤ 500 bytes AND contain only a table (no prose paragraphs before/after). | The pointer file becomes a narrative — now the agent reads it to "understand" instead of to "look up". |
| R5 | Every `docs/*.md` file ≤ 7KB is "self-contained summary".  Every file > 7KB must have a `*_DETAIL.md` companion whose name starts with the summary's filename minus `.md`. | A long doc that doesn't split — agent reads 12KB to get the 2KB it needed. |
| R6 | `_DETAIL.md` companions must be referenced (linked) from their summary file.  A `_DETAIL.md` with no inbound link is an "orphan detail" and must be deleted or referenced. | Dead file that future agents trip over. |
| R7 | Principles (P-n) are defined in EITHER `PRINCIPLES.md` (summary, brief) OR `PRINCIPLES_DETAIL.md` (full text), per the P11 split in commit `f753ec3`.  Any other `docs/*.md` may REFERENCE a P-n but must NOT redefine it.  Redefinition is a hard violation.  **Exception**: meta-rules (P22, P23) live in `_DETAIL.md` because their full text is in the same file as the P-n list. | Drift: parent says P7 is X, child says P7 is Y — system collapses. |
| R8 | Cross-project links use relative paths (`../other-project/...`).  Absolute paths or `https://` (except for external sources) are not allowed in `docs/`. | A doc breaks when the project is moved or cloned. |
| R9 | Every `docs/*.md` must begin with a single-line `L0:` frontmatter (≤ 120 chars) describing what the file is, in plain language.  This line is the L0 layer; the rest is L1+. | Doc with no L0 = not findable by the L0-only reader. |
| R10 | Every `docs/*.md` should end with a `Last P20-verified: YYYY-MM-DD` line, updated whenever the doc is meaningfully changed. | Stale doc — the L0/L1/L2 contract was true on date X but may have rotted. |
| R11 | Before commit, mentally check R1-R10 against any changed/new `docs/*.md` file. | New doc slipped in without verify, rotting the layer contract. |
| R12 | When `PRINCIPLES.md` is modified, every child project's `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md` (if it exists) must be re-synced in the SAME commit.  Per P21. | Parent-child drift: parent adds P22, child doesn't know, child cites "P1-P21" forever. |

How to use this list (per user 2026-07-10 'doc > script' 哲学):
1. Before any `docs/*.md` change, mentally check R1-R12.
2. No mechanical script — doc-level self-discipline.
3. If a rule is too strict in practice, update the rule — don't
   skip or weaken it.

### P21. Independent projects (cross-project boundaries)

When a project is referenced from another project's docs, the
referencing project should **link to a location, not duplicate
content**.  The referenced project should be **readable on its
own** (or have a single, clearly-stated "this is incomplete,
read the parent" disclaimer).

**实操 (L2)**: when referencing another project, link to a path,
not copy content.  Use EXTENSIONS.md as pointer file.  Per Doc
root.

Rules:
- Each project has its own `docs/` tree, its own PRINCIPLES,
  its own PHILOSOPHY (when relevant).  No "main project owns
  the truth" assumption.
- Cross-project links use relative paths (`../other-project/...`),
  not absolute paths or doc IDs.
- A project's PHILOSOPHY may inherit principles from another
  project **only if** the inherited text is reproduced in full
  (no "see P7 in parent" shortcuts).  Add a `synced from
  <parent> as of <date>` marker so drift is detectable.
- A principle that is "new" to a child project must be
  **proposed in the parent first**, then the child can reference
  it.  A child cannot mint new principles the parent doesn't have.

This is the formal statement of the philosophy behind
`docs/EXTENSIONS.md` (parent) and `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md` (children).

**P22 + P23 (meta-rules)** are listed in the L0 axiom table above
and the L1 children column.  See `PRINCIPLES_DETAIL.md` for full
text.  R12 in P20.细则 governs child-project sync.


### P25. Principle modification discipline (per user 2026-07-14, lifted from commit f6c796d by commit 33)

Modifying principles (P-n) or operating rules (M-*) is
**higher risk than editing other docs** because:

- All future agents will read and apply the modified rule.
- A wrong P-n propagates as silent system drift.
- A contradiction with existing rules breaks the
  M-self-audit 6-step checks.

**Required procedure** (per user "修改原则的时候需要
先阅读原则，这里的修改需要非常谨慎，这条感觉也需
要你记到原则里"):

1. **Read first**: load PRINCIPLES.md + the specific
   doc containing the M-* rule to be modified.  Read
   FULL text (not skim).  Same as M-must-read but for
   doc modification.

2. **Identify root axiom**: which of the 4 root axioms
   (奥卡姆 / Workflow / Test / Doc) does the change
   descend from?  Per the L0 table at the top of this
   doc.

3. **Verify no duplication**: check that no existing
   P-n or M-* covers the proposed change.  If similar
   rule exists, extend it; don't create parallel rules.

4. **Draft with all 4 elements**: trigger, action,
   anti-patterns, rationale.  Per P11 (摘要+引用) +
   M-self-application 4-level.

5. **Impact analysis** (per P-n vs M-* boundary 段
   below): which existing rules reference the
   modified rule?  Are cross-refs still valid?
   Is the new rule a P-n or M-* per the 3-case
   test (P-n about work / M-* about agent behavior /
   P-n about principles themselves)?

6. **Commit with detailed trace**: cite the P-n
   modified, cite the user message that motivated
   the change, list cross-refs to update.

7. **Post-modify re-apply new rules check**
   (per user meta-rule 2026-07-14, codified in
   commit 41): after the commit lands, re-apply
   **every newly-cited or newly-modified rule**
   from the batch to the **work-state of the
   batch itself** (not just to the future).
   This is the explicit self-referential step.

   Why: per user "修改原则后需要在新规则的情
   况下检查，这点你应该已经学到原则并且顺利
   运用".  Per P26 step 4: "Document the
   verification".  Without this step, a P-n
   modification can pass all 6 procedural steps
   yet still leave the work-state invisible to
   fresh agents.

   Mechanism (per P26 fresh-agent simulation):

   a. For each **newly added or modified P-n or
      M-*** in the batch: simulate a fresh agent
      running that rule against the work just
      committed.

   b. If simulation reveals a gap (e.g. cross-
      ref missing, doc not findable, test not
      passing) — fix in the same commit (or in
      a follow-up commit if gap requires new
      logical feature).

   c. If simulation passes — explicitly state
      "fresh-agent simulation passed" in the
      commit message body (this is P26 step 4
      "document the verification").

   This step is **distinct from** step 6
   ("commit with detailed trace"): step 6
   traces the **procedural correctness** of
   the modification; step 7 verifies the
   **work-state discoverability** after the
   modification.

**Anti-patterns**:

- Modify P-n without reading all existing P-n first.
- Create parallel rules instead of extending existing.
- Skip "root axiom" check — orphans the rule.
- Cite the change as "fix typo" or "minor update" —
  principle modification is always significant.
- **Skip step 7 (post-modify re-apply new rules
  check)**: the rule lands, but fresh agents
  can't discover the work.  This is the failure
  mode P26 was designed to catch.
- **Treat step 7 as optional**: it is not.
  P26 makes fresh-agent simulation **mandatory**
  at user-acceptance time.  Step 7 makes it
  mandatory at P-n modification time too.

**Self-application** (per M-self-application 4-level):

- This procedure applies to ITSELF: modifying THIS
  P25 requires reading it first + impact analysis +
  extended commit message.
- Per M-self-application 4-level level 2: rule-itself
  audit.  Future modification of this P25 must follow
  this same procedure.
- **Step 7 self-application**: when this段 is
  modified, the new step (step 7) must be applied
  to the work-state of THIS commit (i.e. extending
  P25 must include post-modify fresh-agent check
  of the P25 extension itself).
- **Bootstrap exception**: the original commit
  that introduced step 7 (commit 41) cannot have
  applied step 7 to itself before step 7 was
  codified.  The first application is implicit
  (the commit 41 message body documents the
  fresh-agent simulation run for the **previous**
  batch 37-40, plus for the P25 extension
  itself).

**实操 (L2)**: per principle / M-* rule modification,
follow the 6-step procedure in order.  Skip any step
only if explicitly justified in commit message.

**See also**:

- `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` "P-n vs M-* boundary"段 (the
  3-case classification test).
- `docs/OPERATING_RULES.md` "User-provided meta-rules
  → codify to doc"段 (related M-* rule about
  codification process).
- AGENTS.md "Read FULLY before modifying" pointer.

### P26. User-acceptance must include fresh-agent discoverability check (per user recurring meta-rule, 2026-07-14)

Per user 2026-07-14 recurring instruction (cited
"many times"): "在给用户验收这个agent规则的项目
的时候，需要判断新agent是否能获取它应该知道的
东西".

This rule formalizes M-self-audit step 2 ("new-agent
simulation") as a **first-class P-n**, because:
1. User-recurring check is more authoritative than
   agent-derived codification (per M_RULE_AUTHORING:
   user-provided rules bypass 3-condition gate).
2. The check applies regardless of agent (P-n test:
   "what should be true at handoff?") — not just
   "how should the agent behave" (M-* test).
3. Without explicit P-n, future agents may
   de-prioritize the check as "just an audit step".

**Trigger**: when delivering work to user for
acceptance (e.g. "all pass" / "ready for review" /
"this batch is done"), AND when ending a session
that may be resumed by a different agent.

**Action**: before claiming "ready for user acceptance":

1. **Self-pose the fresh-agent simulation**: pick a
   hypothetical agent that has zero context about
   this session (no memory, no recent commits read,
   no informal context).  What would they see?

2. **Check discoverability for each claim of
   completion**: for each "done" / "complete" /
   "fixed" / "added" assertion in the batch, can a
   fresh agent find the evidence?
   - Files: are they in expected locations?
   - Docs: are they up-to-date (R10)?
   - Cross-refs: do they resolve (R8)?
   - Tests: do they pass?

3. **Apply M-self-audit step 2 explicitly**: read
   `docs/M_SELF_AUDIT.md` step 2 and run the
   "could new agent" prompt.

4. **Document the verification**: in commit message
   body (parent verification) or session summary,
   state the fresh-agent simulation result.

**Anti-patterns**:

- Claim "all pass" or "ready for user" without
  fresh-agent simulation → silent gap on user
  side.
- Treat M-self-audit step 2 as optional
  ("just an audit step") → it is a P-n.
- Only simulate your own memory of the work
  ("I remember doing X, so X is done") → this is
  NOT fresh-agent simulation.
- Skip the check for "obvious" tasks → the
  obvious ones are where gaps hide.

**实操 (L2)**:

Per M-self-audit 6-step checklist, step 2 is
"new-agent simulation".  P26 makes this **mandatory**
at user-acceptance time, not optional.  Per R11
("before commit, mentally check R1-R10"), the
fresh-agent check is a meta-check on top of R11:
not "is the doc structured right?" but "could
a fresh agent find what they need to verify
the structure?".

**Self-application**:

P26 applies to itself: when modifying P26, the
fresh-agent check must pass (can a fresh agent
discover the new check?).  Per P25 6-step
procedure (the sibling meta-principle about
principle modification).

**See also**:

- `docs/M_SELF_AUDIT.md` step 2 (the operational
  checklist this rule formalizes).
- `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` "P-n vs M-* boundary"段
  (P25 explains why P26 is P-n not M-*).
- AGENTS.md "Hard rules"段 (P26 candidate for
  inclusion in top-6 invariant list, depending
  on user preference).
- `docs/OPERATING_RULES.md` "User-provided meta-
  rules → codify to doc"段 (the M-* rule about
  codification that this P-n extends).

---

### P27. Project self-organization (per c52 SELF_ORG + commit 73)

Per M_RULE_AUTHORING 3-condition gate + P25 6-step:

**Trigger** (when this principle should fire):
- After every commit (post-commit phase)
- After every P-n / M-* modification
- After every doc reorganization
- After every parent verification (SUMMARY_LIFECYCLE)
- When project state entropy is detected (per c44 audit finding)

**Action** (what the principle requires):

1. **Top-down check**: project docs should be in
   top-down + 分治 structure (per P20 progressive
   disclosure).
2. **类比 check**: are there 5 essence families
   in current docs? per P22 step 3.
3. **Ordering check**: are P-n in numerical order?
   per P14 doc ordering.
4. **Cross-ref check**: every new doc has parent
   (per P13).
5. **Cap check**: every doc ≤ 7KB / 300 lines
   (per R5/R8).
6. **L0 + R10 check**: L0 line present,
   Last P20-verified stamped (per R9/R10).
7. **Inductive check**: per P22 step 3, find
   commonalities; per P-n vs M-* boundary
   3-case test, decide where new content lives.

**Anti-patterns** (what this principle prevents):

- Wait for user prompting before organizing
- Ad-hoc reorganization (no plan)
- Add new structure without removing old
- Skip the "obviously broken" cases

**Rationale**: Per user meta-rule 2026-07-14:
"未来我不说的话, 这项目会自己整理原则和项目为
顺序规范吗?". Per P20 progressive disclosure
applied recursively (this principle self-applies
to project docs).

**Bootstrap exception**: This principle was
codified explicitly in commit 73, so prior
commits predating P27 did not auto-apply it.
Going forward, every commit should fire
P27 checks.

**实操 (L2)**: Per commit, agent should
self-apply 7-check (top-down + class + ordering
+ cross-ref + cap + L0+R10 + inductive) BEFORE
commit.  Per Doc + Workflow roots.

**Relationship**: P27 is **meta-principle**
spanning all 4 root axioms (奥卡姆 / Workflow /
Test / Doc).  Per P22 case 3 boundary test
(principle about principles), P27 is **P-n
meta, not M-***.

### Recursion (P28 candidate, per skill b502577 + user meta-rule 2026-07-15)

**Trigger** (when recursion should be invoked):
- When the project itself is the problem
- When P-n / M-* are being evaluated for self-application
- When the agent is reviewing its own behavior at a
  meta level
- When SUA's sibling project (agent-reflection-skill)
  receives a self-application request from the user

**Action** (what recursion requires):
1. Apply any P-n to the project itself (not just to
   artifacts the project produces).
2. Apply M-self-application to M-self-application
   (per M-self-application 4-level L4, the highest
   level is the agent's own behavior pattern).
3. Cross-reference sister project (skill) before
   making meta-decisions.
4. Limit recursion to depth 2 (primitives on self,
   not primitives on primitives on self).

**Why recursion is a candidate, not yet P28**:
- Per M_RULE_AUTHORING 3-condition gate, this is
  the **1st observed occurrence** of the recursion
  primitive in SUA (the previous 4 primitives were
  in skill).
- Per P25 6-step, lifting to P28 requires: read
  first + root axiom (cross-axiom, like P27) +
  no duplication (no existing P-n covers recursion)
  + 4 elements (above) + impact analysis +
  commit with trace + post-modify re-apply new
  rules check.
- This 段 **does the impact analysis** but stops
  short of full lift.  When the next 2+ SUA
  commits demonstrate recursion, then P28 lift.

**Cross-axiom position** (like P27): recursion
spans all 4 root axioms (it is the *act of applying
P-n to self*, not the *content* of any single P-n).
Per 信息拓扑 方案 C (c81): cross-axiom principles
live flat in PRINCIPLES.md (and detail in
PRINCIPLES_FULL.md), not in PRINCIPLES_DETAIL_DETAIL.md.

**Cross-ref** to skill b502577: 6th reasoning
primitive (recursion) in
`../agent-reflection-skill/docs/framework/analogy-and-induction.md`.
The skill commit also adds a "Self-application" 段
demonstrating recursion on the skill itself.

**P28 LIFT (per c96, 2026-07-15)**: per M_RULE_AUTHORING
3-condition gate + 你 directive "不用找我确认"
+ bootstrap exception:

- **Trigger**: when agent (or project) needs to
  apply P-n to itself.
- **Action**: explicit recursive loop with depth
  limit 2 (per M-n 12 boundary + memory 9 trap
  detection).
- **Why lift now**: c82 candidate + c92 M-n 12
  self-application + c93 L2 self-application +
  c94 MCP-first self-application + c95 autonomy
  boundary self-application = **5+ observed
  recursion demos** (3-condition gate met).
- **Apply to**: project self-organization, doc
  structure, P-n evaluation, M-rule refinement.

### P29 (agent 主动 reduce context, PROPOSED per c165)

> Per M_RULE_AUTHORING 3-condition gate + 你
> vision + P22 case-3 boundary test.

**Why P29 is proposed**:

P29 = "agent 主动 reduce context" (主动 reduces
context via 类比 + 节点 生命周期 + periodic
re-analysis + pace continuity + 3-layer).

**M_RULE_AUTHORING 3-condition gate**:

- **Condition 1 (3+ sites)**: ✅ PASS
  - c44 framework codify
  - c50 docs framework applied
  - c74 P27 cross-axiom
  - c115 整理 (整理 = analyze + induction + sort)
  - c122 M-n 23 re-analysis
  - c127 re-analysis 3 issues
  - c163 修订 L4 boundary explicit
  - **Total: 7+ sites**
- **Condition 2 (triggerable)**: ✅ PASS
  - Trigger: 整理 / re-analysis / pace-
    continuity / context-too-large
- **Condition 3 (5+ observed)**: ✅ PASS
  - All 7 sites above are observed cases

**Gate met: P29 PROPOSAL**.

**P-n vs M-* boundary (per c33 case 3 test)**:
P29 = case 3 (principle about how project
self-organizes).  Like P22 (stuck→plan), P25
(principle modification discipline), P26 (fresh-
agent check), P27 (project self-org), P28
(recursion to self).

**4-element 段**:

1. **Trigger**: when project 做了 很久 OR
   context exceeds threshold OR multiple
   complex cases accumulate.
2. **Action** (4 sub-steps per M-n 14 + M-n 18 +
   M-n 23 + M-n 24):
   - (1) Identify when context exceeds threshold
     (per M-n 23).
   - (2) Apply 类比 to find similar prior patterns
     (per M-n 14 entropy decrease).
   - (3) Compress to essence (per M-n 14
     compression + M-n 18 节点 生命周期).
   - (4) Destroy redundant summaries (per M-n 18
     destruction contract).
3. **Why**: makes agent 不 depend on external
   context management + applies 4 root axioms
   + extends P27 self-org + P28 recursion.
4. **Anti-patterns**:
   - **Don't** 主动 reduce without identifying
     threshold (premature compression).
   - **Don't** skip 类比 step (compress
     without finding pattern = loss of
     meaning).
   - **Don't** destroy before summarizing (per
     M-n 18 destruction contract).
   - **Don't** apply when context is small
     (奥卡姆 = simplicity, not brevity).

**Cross-axiom integration**:

P29 spans all 4 root axioms (per P22 case-3 +
extends P27 cross-axiom + P28 meta-meta):

| Root axiom | How P29 applies |
|---|---|
| Test | Re-analysis verifies context reduction |
| Doc | Context reduction keeps docs concise |
| Workflow | Pace-continuity avoids context overflow |
| 奥卡姆 | Reduces to essence (per M-n 14 entropy) |

**5 essence family placement**:

P29 belongs to **Meta-rules** family (like P22,
P23, P25, P26, P27, P28).  Essence: **process
for the process itself** (主动 reduce context
is process-for-process).

**Status**:

P29 is **proposed** (not yet fully working).
Per P25 6-step, lifting to full P29 requires:
- (1) Read existing P-n for overlap check ✅
  (no overlap with P27 or P28)
- (2) M_RULE_AUTHORING 3-condition gate ✅ (all 3
  pass)
- (3) Bootstrap exception for codification ✅

**LIFT vs PROPOSED distinction**:

Per c96 P28 LIFT pattern, P29 is currently
**PROPOSED** (not fully LIFT).  Full LIFT
requires:
- 1+ future commit demonstrating P29 applied
  to a project self-organization task
- User confirmation (per 你 vision "自动

### P30. Separation of Construction and Acceptance

**Core invariant**: no agent or epistemic role that materially modifies an
artifact may issue the terminal acceptance decision for that same resulting
artifact in the same evaluation cycle. The constructor cannot be the final
acceptor.

**CONSTRUCTOR CANNOT BE THE FINAL ACCEPTOR.**

This applies to manuscripts, code, experiments, figures, tables, datasets,
analysis pipelines, checkers, prompts, repository structures, research
decisions, and any other artifact whose evaluated state has material authorship
from the modifying role. It is a role-separation invariant, not a claim that a
different model is automatically independent.

#### Why this is a principle

The failure mechanism is epistemic-role coupling, not merely insufficient
model intelligence. The implementer knows why the change was made, knows the
intended interpretation, designs checks around anticipated failure modes, and
can unconsciously fill gaps that a fresh evaluator would notice. A self-authored
checker covers only the dimensions it encodes. Stronger models do not remove
this need for separation.

#### Three validation states

| State | Meaning | Who may issue it | What it does not mean |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LOCAL FIX VERIFIED** | The requested modification was implemented and the targeted local issue was checked. | Implementer. | Not artifact acceptance. |
| **REGRESSION PASS** | Frozen invariants and previously specified checks remain satisfied. | Implementer and/or automated checker. | Not artifact acceptance. |
| **INDEPENDENT ACCEPTANCE PASS** | A fresh-state evaluator judged the resulting artifact against the stage-level acceptance objective after independent inspection. | Only an evaluator that did not materially implement the accepted artifact state. | Not implied by a local fix or checker result. |

Only **INDEPENDENT ACCEPTANCE PASS** may authorize terminal acceptance, freeze,
or submission-readiness for that stage.

#### Terminal vocabulary

An agent that materially implemented the artifact must not return terminal
language such as `PASS`, `ACCEPTED`, `FINAL`, `READY FOR SUBMISSION`,
`SCIENTIFICALLY ACCEPTED`, or `PUBLICATION READY` for that artifact. It may
return implementation-level status such as:

- `IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / READY FOR INDEPENDENT AUDIT`;
- `TARGETED CORRECTIONS COMPLETE / READY FOR INDEPENDENT AUDIT`;
- `PROTOTYPE COMPLETE / READY FOR EVALUATION`; or
- `EXPERIMENT COMPLETE / READY FOR INDEPENDENT INTERPRETATION`.

`REGRESSION PASS` is allowed only as the bounded regression state defined
above; it must not be presented as terminal artifact acceptance.

#### Material modification invalidates old acceptance

Any material modification automatically makes the previous acceptance state
stale for the modified artifact:

```text
OLD_ACCEPTANCE_STATE = STALE
```

A new independent acceptance is required. A minor non-semantic change may be
exempt only when it cannot alter the evaluated claim, result, interpretation,
or reader-visible artifact. When uncertain, treat the change as material.

#### Epistemic reset and evaluator independence

Where feasible, the independent evaluator follows this order:

```text
1. ARTIFACT FIRST
2. FRESH INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT
3. FREEZE FIRST-PASS FINDINGS
4. READ IMPLEMENTATION REPORTS / CHECKERS / RATIONALE
5. RECONCILE
6. ISSUE TERMINAL DECISION
```

The evaluator should not materially author the current artifact state, should
not implement the change being judged, and should not design the exact local
fix now being accepted. A new conversation or agent instance is preferred
when practical, but a new agent label alone is insufficient if the evaluator
is pre-anchored by an implementation-success narrative. The required
property is epistemic independence plus artifact-first inspection.

#### Implementer-authored checkers

Implementer-authored checkers are **REGRESSION EVIDENCE**. They may verify
hashes, counts, frozen numerical invariants, expected strings, protocol
fields, build success, known prior defects, and consistency constraints. They
are not sufficient evidence for scientific validity, manuscript quality,
conceptual completeness, reviewer acceptance, publication readiness, or the
absence of unknown failure modes:

```text
CHECKER PASS != INDEPENDENT ACCEPTANCE PASS
```

#### OPEN-WORLD ACCEPTANCE

Targeted repair validation asks, “Did we fix the issue we already knew
about?” Independent acceptance also asks, “What material issue remains that
the implementer did not already target?” The evaluator must actively search
for unanticipated contradictions, stale assumptions, side effects, newly
introduced inconsistencies, missing evidence, misleading framing, semantic
drift, and artifact-level quality defects. It must not limit itself to the
implementer’s checklist.

#### No self-certifying loop

The following closure pattern is prohibited:

```text
IMPLEMENT → WRITE CHECKER → RUN CHECKER → PASS → FREEZE
```

The required pattern is:

```text
IMPLEMENT
→ LOCAL VERIFICATION
→ REGRESSION CHECK
→ HANDOFF
→ INDEPENDENT FRESH-STATE AUDIT
→ ACCEPT / MODIFY / STOP
```

There is no direct path from `IMPLEMENTED` to `ACCEPTED` without independent
audit.

**No direct path from:** `IMPLEMENTED` to `ACCEPTED` without independent audit.

#### Role-specific authority

The implementer may modify, test, run local checks, report regressions,
prepare the handoff, and state known limitations. The implementer may not
issue final acceptance of its own modified artifact.

The independent evaluator may inspect the artifact, identify new issues,
classify blocker/material/optional findings, and issue the terminal decision.
The evaluator should not silently modify the artifact during the same
acceptance pass. If the evaluator materially edits the artifact, its
evaluator role terminates; the artifact returns to implementation state and
must undergo another independent audit afterward.

#### Acceptance state machine

```text
ACCEPTED_n
→ MATERIAL MODIFICATION
→ IMPLEMENTED_n+1
→ LOCAL FIX VERIFIED
→ REGRESSION PASS
→ READY FOR INDEPENDENT AUDIT
→ INDEPENDENT ACCEPTANCE PASS
→ ACCEPTED_n+1
```

If independent audit finds a material issue:

```text
READY FOR INDEPENDENT AUDIT
→ MODIFY
→ IMPLEMENTED_n+2
→ ...
```

No direct path from `IMPLEMENTED` to `ACCEPTED` is permitted.

#### Named failure class

**CORRELATED VALIDATION FAILURE** is the condition in which the same
epistemic role creates or materially modifies a claim or artifact and then
evaluates it using checks or assumptions derived from its own construction
process, producing false confidence in acceptance.

Typical symptoms include a local fix reported as global `PASS`, a checker
passing while a prose or semantic contradiction remains, an implementer
explaining away ambiguity that a fresh reader would notice, new errors outside
checker coverage, or reuse of a previous acceptance after material
modification. This failure class triggers independent audit.

#### Relation to existing SUA principles

P30 supplements, and does not replace, opposing argument, failure pre-mortem,
self-audit, falsification, anti-sunk-cost, Add-Then-Reduce, and evidence
gates. Self-audit is necessary but not sufficient for terminal acceptance.
The principle controls authority and information order; existing principles
continue to control evidence, safety, falsification, and scope.

#### Proportionality exception

P30 is required when a material artifact was modified, a scientific result
was generated, a manuscript was substantively revised, a method or experiment
was constructed and then judged for terminal acceptance, or a high-stakes gate
may freeze research state. It is not required for trivial wording
suggestions, brainstorming, low-stakes exploratory reasoning, or non-terminal
local checks.

#### Reusable project-adapter template

```text
IMPLEMENTATION ROLE
- may modify;
- may locally verify;
- may report regression results;
- terminal status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / READY FOR INDEPENDENT AUDIT.

INDEPENDENT AUDIT ROLE
- fresh evaluator;
- artifact-first inspection;
- no modification during first-pass audit;
- freeze first-pass findings before reading implementation rationale;
- only this role may return: PASS / MODIFY / STOP.
```

#### Self-application

P30 applies to the amendment that defines it: this implementation may report
local verification and regression evidence, but it must not issue independent
acceptance of the resulting SUA state. A future evaluator must inspect the
updated canonical surfaces first, freeze first-pass findings, then read this
implementation report and reconcile once.

**Status for this implementation cycle**:

```text
SUA AMENDMENT IMPLEMENTED / READY FOR INDEPENDENT SUA AUDIT
```

### M-n 25 self-application: user message-pattern-recognition (per c183 + P28 recursion)

> L0: M-n 25 = "user message-pattern-recognition"
> (per user message 2026-07-15 explicit codify
> request).  This段 is M-n 25 applied to
> itself (per P28 recursion + M-self-
> application 4 levels).

**M-n 25 in 1 sentence**: When agent receives
a user message, parse the parts (directive /
真问题 / 真意 / 隐含 codify / 隐含
verification) and recognize which of 5
patterns (A-E) it matches.

**5 patterns A-E** (per c183 + c185 verification):

| Pattern | Structure | Example | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | 2-3 parts + directive | "M-n 21 + top-down 默认" | M-n 12 + M-n 22 + direct M-rule |
| B | 3-4 parts + 真问题 | "M-n 22 + 自顶向下 + 继续" | M-n 22 + 答 真问题 |
| C | 5 parts + 真问题 + 隐含 codify | "5 directives + 学习思路 + 有没有学过" | codify new M-n |
| D | directive + 真问题 verify | "skill 跟 SUA 规范 + 做到了吗？" | M-n 21 答 + apply directive |
| E | implicit + 主动 | "按计划继续推进" | M-n 24 commit + continue |

**M-n 25 self-application (per P28 recursion +
M-self-application 4 levels)**:

- **L1 (object)**: M-n 25 rule = parse +
  recognize user message patterns.
- **L2 (rule)**: M-n 25 rule = M-self-
  application 4 levels applied to user message
  recognition.
- **L3 (memory)**: M-n 25 codified +
  persisted (entry 7 + M_TURN_PATTERN_
  RECOGNITION_DETAIL.md).
- **L4 (behavior)**: Future agents apply
  M-n 25 when receiving user message.

**Why M-n 25 is meta-meta-meta (per P28 +
P29 cross-axiom)**:

- P22 case 3: principle about principles
- P28 (recursion): applied to M-n 25 itself
- P29 (agent 主动 reduce context): M-n 25
  helps agent recognize user message patterns,
  which reduces clarification back-and-forth
  (= context reduction)
- M-n 25 IS M-self-application level 4
  applied to a specific domain (user message
  recognition)

**Cross-references**:

- SUA `docs/OPERATING_RULES.md` § M-message-
  pattern-recognition段 (M-n 25 main 段)
- SUA `docs/M_TURN_PATTERN_RECOGNITION_DETAIL.md`

- user message 2026-07-15 — origin (Pattern C)

**Status**: M-n 25 self-application段
codified (per c185 verification).  This
demonstrates P28 recursion: M-n 25 is
applied to itself in 4 levels (L1: parse
rule; L2: rule about rule; L3: memory of
rule; L4: behavior change due to rule).

## P-n vs M-* boundary (clarification per user 2026-07-14)

When proposing a new rule, decide which category it
belongs to BEFORE drafting (per M-intent-parsing
"过原则再判断"):

| Category | Question it answers | When to use | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P-n** (principle) | "What should be true?" | Atomic, stable, applies to all projects.  Cited in commit messages.  Needs `commit-msg` hook allow-list update. | P5 测通 / P7 奥卡姆 / P11 摘要+引用 / P14 docs current / P17 老实说 / P22 stuck→plan / P23 doc>script |
| **M-*** (workflow) | "How should the agent behave?" | Behavioral, agent-self-management, project-specific extensions of the meta-rules. | M-task-summary / M-must-read / M-context-snapshot / M-subtask-summary / M-intent-parsing / M-learn / M-add-then-reduce / M-self-audit / M-self-application |

**Decision rule** (per M-add-then-reduce signal-trigger):

- If the rule describes **agent behavior** (e.g.
  "before X, do Y" / "after W, capture Z") → **M-***.
- If the rule describes **principle that should
  hold regardless of agent** (e.g. "tests must
  pass before commit" / "奥卡姆 applies to
  docs") → **P-n**.

**Why this matters** (per user 2026-07-14):

M-self-audit 6-step audit checklist (e.g. step 6
"verify-before-edit") is a **workflow rule** because
it describes agent behavior, not a principle.  Putting
it in PRINCIPLES.md (as a new P25) would have been
**mis-categorization** — the rule is HOW to behave,
not WHAT should be true.  The actual fix: extend
M-self-audit step 6 (in `docs/M_SELF_AUDIT.md`),
not add a new P-n.

**3rd case — meta-principles about principles**
(per commit 33 follow-up audit, 2026-07-14):

The boundary table above has 2 cases.  A 3rd case
exists but was missed in the original (commit 5263030):

- **Meta-principle about principles**: a rule that
  describes **how principles themselves should
  behave**, not how the agent behaves.  This is
  different from a workflow rule (about agent
  behavior) and from a normal principle (about
  the work).

  Examples:
  - P22 (stuck→plan): meta-principle about how
    problem-solving should proceed.
  - P23 (doc>script with nuance): meta-principle
    about how tool choice should be made.
  - **P25 candidate**: "principle modification
    discipline" (committed as
    `docs/OPERATING_RULES.md` M-*段 in commit f6c796d,
    but **mis-classified** — should be P25 per
    this 3rd case).
  - **P26 candidate**: "user-acceptance must include
    fresh-agent discoverability check" (was
    M-self-audit step 2 in `docs/M_SELF_AUDIT.md`,
    user-recurring meta-rule, lifted by commit 39).
    Reason: the rule is **about what should be true
    at user-acceptance time** (not just "how the
    agent should behave when auditing") — i.e. it's
    a principle about the **handoff state**, not
    about audit procedure.

  **Test for meta-principle about principles**:
  Ask "does this rule describe how principles
  themselves should behave, OR how the agent should
  behave when modifying principles?"  If the former
  → P-n.  If the latter → M-*.

  **Implication for commit f6c796d**: the段
  "P-n / M-* modification discipline" should be
  in PRINCIPLES.md as P25, not in OPERATING_RULES.md
  as M-*.  See commit 33 follow-up.

**Anti-patterns**:

- **Don't promote a workflow rule to P-n** just
  because it's important.  Importance ≠ atomicity.
- **Don't demote a principle to M-*** just because
  it's hard to express as a workflow.  Principles
  can be meta (P22, P23 are meta-principles about
  process).
- **Don't add a new P-n to bypass M-self-audit's
  3-condition gate** for M-rules.  The gate exists
  precisely to keep workflow rules at the right
  level (per agent-onboarding skill
  `references/M_RULE_AUTHORING.md` 3-condition gate).

**See also**:

- `docs/OPERATING_RULES.md` — the 9 M-* rules and
  their canonical brief form.
- `docs/M_SELF_AUDIT.md` — audit checklist that
  checks both P-n adherence and M-* behavior.
- `docs/EXTENSIONS.md` X2 — cross-project M-rule
  source (where canonical 9 M-rules live).

## L2: 实操 (per P-n)

Each P-n has a 1-line "实操" describing how to actually follow the
principle.  See [PRINCIPLES_DETAIL.md](PRINCIPLES_DETAIL.md) for the
full list.  L2 is the third layer of progressive disclosure
(L0 = root axioms, L1 = principles, L2 = how to follow).
