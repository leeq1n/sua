# PROJECT_STATE — brief
> L0: Current project state (1-paragraph).  Load when: need snapshot of current goal/version/next step.

## Goal

**SUA is an agent-discipline knowledge library.**  It packages agent
behavior rules (P-n working principles + M-n operating rules),
reasoning primitives, and operating conventions that any agent
runtime can carry into a project.  The repo is self-contained and
does not depend on sibling repositories.

The current top-level project goal is **Phase A AI4S self-application**:
improve scientific-research behavior by routing existing SUA primitives
through the project-layer scientific-state controller in
`AI4S_RESEARCH_MODE.md`. Satellite-security episodes are regression fixtures,
not active research directions. Phase A does not authorize core-layer changes.

## What the repo holds

| Area | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Operating contract | `core-layer/AGENTS_CORE.md` + `AGENTS.md` | always-loaded rules + per-task 段s (P11 split) |
| Knowledge library | `docs/` | principles, operating rules, design, conventions |
| AI4S research adapter | `docs/AI4S_RESEARCH_MODE.md` | scientific-state routing and evidence gates for new-knowledge tasks |
| Governance | `core-layer/` | 3-layer policy (核心/用户/项目) + modification gates |
| Commit gates | `hooks/` + `agent-tools/scripts/` | commit-msg / pre-commit / pre-push / prepare-commit-msg |
| Legacy runtime | `core/` + `src/` + `self_upgrade/` | v1.x-v3.x self-improving agent (documented legacy, functional) |

## Current version

Latest CHANGELOG entry: **v2.22.x** (see `CHANGELOG.md`).  Release
history is documented there; `README_DETAIL.md` covers the legacy
code (v1.x-v3.x), which is kept because tests and CLI scripts
exercise `src/` (removing it would break CI).

## Tests

`pytest tests/` collects ~875 tests.  Environment-dependent failures:
- LLM / network tests skip when no API key or `SUA_SKIP_NETWORK=1`.
- `core/planner.py` is LLM/user-modified (a known open decision —
  keep or revert, see `test_core_planner_md5_matches_head` which is
  deselected).  Harness tests that depend on planner.py's pre-modification
  shape fail until that decision is made.

## Constraints

See `docs/CONSTRAINTS.md` for the full list (奥卡姆, fail-OPEN,
atomic, user-edits-keys-never-agent, etc.).  Project constraints
change rarely; that file is the source of truth.

## Next step

Phase A decision: `PROJECT_LAYER_SUFFICIENT`. See
`AI4S_PHASE_A_VALIDATION.md` for evidence and limitations. The next useful
verification is a controlled fresh-model A/B rerun after provider authorization
is repaired; do not start Phase B or promote a core trigger automatically. The
prior `docs/PLANS/PLAN_2026-07-30.md` remains historical context.
